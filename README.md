### NOTE: This theme works best on the "old" design of Joplin. It has not been integrated with the new design launched Fall 2020.

## joplin theme
# dark mode
a dark mode theme for Joplin.

Joplin is an open source note taking app. Learn more about [Joplin](http://joplinapp.org).

It has been tested on Mac version Joplin Joplin 1.0.232 (prod, darwin)

## 1. Install Font


This theme assumes you have IBM Plex Sans and Victor Mono (for ligature support) installed on your computer.
Thoses fonts are only use for the preview.

Install those from [https://github.com/IBM/plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex) and [https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) or change the following lines in the `:root` section of  `userstyle.css` and `userchrome.css` to your favorite font:
```
--font-sans: "IBM Plex Sans";
--font-mono: "victor mono";
```

## 2. Install Theme
- Open the Joplin app
- Navigate to  `Joplin > Preferences > Appearances`
- Click `Advanced Settings`
- Click `Custom stylesheet for rendered Markdown` and paste the content from `userstyle.css`
- Edit `Custom stylesheet for Joplin-wide app styles` and paste the content from `userchrome.css`


### Apply Changes
The css changes won't apply until you close and reopen the app.

HINT: If you are using Dev Tools to mess with CSS `Help > Toggle Developer tools`, you can hit `Command-R` (Mac) to Force Reload the app to apply the CSS without having to quit.

## 3. Check to see how it looks.
You can paste `css-sample.md` into a new Joplin note to see it in action.

- Make sure to select the "Dark" Theme in `Joplin > Preferences > Appearances`
- Editor font size is set to 14

- HINT: I often have to force quit and restart the app after applying CSS changes and switching notes, not sure why.

## 4. Tweak the variables
Lots of this theme is defined in the `:root` section of  `userstyle.css` and `userchrome.css`. You can update colors and sizing there. Make sure to update the variables in both files!

```
:root {
       --white: #e3e3e3;
    --dark-white: #EEF0EA;
    --light-grey: #A3A79F;
    --dark-grey: #272728;
    --darker-grey: #2e3138;
    --black: #232629;
    --hover-list: #1E4357;
    --base-size-1: 1px;
    --base-size-4: 4px;
    --base-size-8: 8px;
    --base-size-10: 10px;
    --base-size-13: 13px;
    --base-size-18: 18px;
    --base-size-24: 24px;
    --base-size-32: 32px;
    --base-size-40: 40px;
    --base-size-272: 272px;
    --z-toc: 99;
    --font-weight-light: 200;
    --font-weight-base: 400;
    --font-weight-bold: 500;
    --primary: teal;
    --secondary: #00dbcc;
    --font-line-height: 1.4em;
    --font-size: var(--base-size-13);
    --icon-size: var(--font-size);
}
```

I prefer navigating to `~/.config/joplin-desktop` from my editor and editing the two files directly (vs opening them from the Joplin menu).
